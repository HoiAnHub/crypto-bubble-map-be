# External API Rate Limiting Implementation

## 🎯 Problem Solved

The crypto bubble map backend was experiencing **429 (Too Many Requests)** errors from external APIs like CoinGecko and Etherscan due to aggressive API usage without proper rate limiting. This was causing:

- ❌ Failed ETH price fetches
- ❌ Failed gas price updates  
- ❌ Failed transaction history requests
- ❌ Unreliable background data crawling
- ❌ Poor user experience with stale or missing data

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### 1. **Rate Limiting System**

Added intelligent rate limiting to prevent API abuse:

**CoinGecko Rate Limiting:**
- 🕐 **1.2 seconds delay** between requests (50 requests/minute limit)
- 📊 Respects free tier limits
- 🔄 Exponential backoff on rate limit errors

**Etherscan Rate Limiting:**
- 🕐 **200ms delay** between requests (5 requests/second limit)
- 📊 Optimized for API key tier
- 🔄 Automatic retry with backoff

### 2. **Intelligent Caching System**

Implemented Redis-based caching with stale data fallback:

**Cache Strategy:**
- 📦 **5-minute TTL** for ETH price data
- 📦 **3-minute TTL** for Etherscan data
- 📦 **Stale data fallback** when APIs are unavailable
- 📦 **2x TTL storage** to allow stale reads

**Benefits:**
- 🚀 Faster response times
- 🛡️ Resilience during API outages
- 💰 Reduced API usage costs
- 📈 Better user experience

### 3. **Enhanced Error Handling**

**Retry Logic:**
- 🔄 **3 retry attempts** with exponential backoff
- 🎯 **Smart retry conditions** (429, 5xx errors only)
- 📊 **Fallback to cached data** on persistent failures
- 🛡️ **Graceful degradation** with reasonable defaults

**Error Recovery:**
- 📊 Returns reasonable defaults (ETH: $3000, Gas: 20-35 gwei)
- 🔄 Uses stale cached data when available
- 📝 Comprehensive error logging
- 🚨 Prevents cascade failures

## 🔧 Configuration Options

### Environment Variables Added:

```bash
# API Rate Limiting
COINGECKO_REQUESTS_PER_MINUTE=50
COINGECKO_DELAY_MS=1200
ETHERSCAN_REQUESTS_PER_SECOND=5
ETHERSCAN_DELAY_MS=200
```

### Default Settings:

- **CoinGecko**: 50 requests/minute (1.2s delay)
- **Etherscan**: 5 requests/second (200ms delay)
- **Cache TTL**: 300s (5 minutes) for prices
- **Retry Attempts**: 3 with exponential backoff

## 🧪 Testing Results

### Rate Limiting Test Results:
```
✅ CoinGecko rate limiting: 2404ms for 3 calls (expected: ~2400ms)
✅ Etherscan rate limiting: 407ms for 3 calls (expected: ~400ms)
✅ Cache hit/miss logic working correctly
✅ Stale data fallback functioning
```

### Live API Test Results:
```
✅ CoinGecko API call successful (286ms)
💰 ETH Price: $2606.42
✅ Etherscan API call successful (2029ms)
⛽ Gas Prices: Safe=1.31, Standard=1.36, Fast=1.53
```

### Application Startup:
```
✅ Redis connection successful
✅ Background job scheduler started
✅ All services connected (PostgreSQL, Neo4j, Redis)
✅ No rate limiting errors observed
✅ API requests processing successfully
```

## 🚀 Performance Improvements

### Before Implementation:
- ❌ Frequent 429 errors from CoinGecko
- ❌ Failed background data crawling
- ❌ Inconsistent ETH price updates
- ❌ Poor user experience with stale data

### After Implementation:
- ✅ **Zero 429 errors** observed during testing
- ✅ **Reliable background data crawling**
- ✅ **Consistent API responses** with caching
- ✅ **Improved response times** (cache hits)
- ✅ **Better error resilience** with fallbacks

## 🛡️ Resilience Features

### API Failure Handling:
1. **Rate Limit Detection**: Automatic 429 error handling
2. **Exponential Backoff**: Smart retry delays (1s, 2s, 4s)
3. **Stale Data Fallback**: Uses cached data when APIs fail
4. **Reasonable Defaults**: Prevents complete service failure
5. **Comprehensive Logging**: Full error tracking and debugging

### Cache Strategy:
1. **Multi-layer Caching**: Fresh data + stale data fallback
2. **TTL Management**: Optimized cache expiration times
3. **Memory Efficiency**: Redis-based distributed caching
4. **Cache Warming**: Background jobs keep cache fresh

## 📊 Monitoring & Observability

### Logging Added:
- 📝 Rate limiting delays and wait times
